# Ebay-Youtube-Python-Data-Science-Monetization-Example
## 1. Data Science Question: How to possibly measure &amp; monetize Ebay and Youtube Data with Python API?
##### 1.A Background Resesarch: Mathematics Basic Probability ⋅ NLP ⋅ Python API Docs
## 2. Hypothesis: Map Youtube Transcript Text Terms To Ebay Item Cost Name-Price Pairs

## 3. Data Collection:
+ [Extract Dataset for Experiment Example Evidence\(https://github.com/kevin11h/Ebay-Youtube-Python-API-Data-Science-Monetization-Example/blob/master/Youtube%20Video%20Text%20%26%20Ebay%20Item%20Cost%20Name%20Price%20Dataset%20Collection%20CSV.ipynb)

## 4,5. Results Analysis:
+ [Visualization and Communication of Results Insight](https://github.com/kevin11h/Ebay-Youtube-Python-API-Data-Science-Monetization-Example/blob/master/Visualize%20Expected%20Value%20Experiment%20of%20Youtube-Ebay%20Item%20Cost%20Name%20Price%20with%20Math%20Formulas%2C%20Word%20Cloud%20and%20Bar%20Charts.ipynb)
## 6. Conclusion Brief Small Scale Experiment Data Project:
+ Average Mean Term Frequency / Probability ~0.02% and why are item cost so high on ebay, each average around $1000+?

## 7. New Next Question
+ What is the correlation between Youtube Video Text Terms and Ebay Item Prices?
+ Is it monetizable in theory as well as in practice / production?
